# Concurrency Problems in Software Systems

Concurrency issues are common in software systems that involve multiple processes or threads executing simultaneously. This guide explains five major concurrency problems: race conditions, data races, deadlocks, livelocks, and starvation. It also highlights key differences between these problems in terms of scope, detection, and resolution.

## What this guide covers
1. Race Conditions.
2. Data Races.
3. Deadlocks.
4. Livelocks.
5. Starvation.

### 1. Race Conditions.

A race condition occurs when the behavior of a software system depends on the relative timing of events or operations in concurrent execution. This can lead to unpredictable outcomes, as the final state of the system may vary depending on the order and timing of these events.

#### Scope
Broad term that encompasses any situation where the outcome depends on the timing of events in concurrent execution.
#### Detection
Hard to detect and reproduce since they depend on specific timing scenarios.
Symptom: Unpredictable behavior and inconsistent results.
#### Resolution
Redesign the system to eliminate timing dependencies.
Use proper synchronization mechanisms to control access to shared resources.

### 2. Data Races.
A data race is a specific type of race condition that occurs when two or more concurrent operations access the same memory location, and at least one of them is a write operation, without proper synchronization.

#### Scope
Specific type of race condition involving concurrent, unsynchronized access to shared memory where at least one access is a write.
#### Detection
Can be detected using tools like Go's race detector (go run -race).
Symptom: Unpredictable and incorrect behavior due to unsynchronized access.
#### Resolution
Synchronize access to shared memory using mutexes, channels, or atomic operations.
### 3. Deadlocks.
A deadlock occurs when two or more processes or threads are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource, creating a circular dependency.
#### Scope
Involves a circular dependency where multiple processes are waiting on each other to release resources.
Processes are permanently blocked without external intervention.
#### Detection
Can be detected using algorithms like Wait-For Graphs or Resource Allocation Graphs.
Symptom: System or processes are completely stalled with no progress.
#### Resolution
**Prevention**: Design the system to avoid circular wait conditions (e.g., using lock ordering).</br></br>
**Avoidance**: Dynamically allocate resources to avoid circular dependencies (e.g., Banker's algorithm).</br></br>
Use deadlock detection algorithms to identify deadlocks and then terminate or restart one or more processes to break the cycle.
### 4. Livelocks.
A livelock occurs when two or more processes or threads continuously change their state in response to each other without making any real progress. Unlike deadlock, the processes are not blocked but are in a state of perpetual motion.
#### Scope
Involves processes continuously changing states or retrying operations without making progress.
Processes are not blocked but are in a state of perpetual motion.
#### Detection
Harder to detect because processes are still running and changing states.
Requires monitoring system behavior over time to identify lack of progress despite continuous activity.</br></br>
**Symptom**: High CPU utilization without actual task completion, frequent state changes with no end result.
#### Resolution
**Prevention**: Design algorithms to avoid frequent retries and to ensure eventual progress (e.g., use exponential backoff strategies, add randomness to retry intervals).</br></br>
**Progress Assurance**: Implement mechanisms that guarantee progress over time, such as priority schemes or fair scheduling.
### 5. Starvation.
Starvation occurs when a process or thread is perpetually denied the resources it needs to proceed, often because other processes or threads are monopolizing those resources.
#### Scope
Involves a situation where one or more processes cannot make progress because they are continuously denied access to necessary resources.
#### Detection
Requires monitoring system behavior over time to identify processes that are not making progress.</br>

**Symptom**: Some processes are not progressing while others continue to execute.
#### Resolution
**Prevention**: Ensure fair scheduling and resource allocation.</br></br>
**Resource Management**: Implement mechanisms that ensure all processes get a chance to proceed, such as priority schemes or aging techniques.
